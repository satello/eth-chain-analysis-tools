# Ethereum Chain Analysis Tools.

These scripts are for analyzing a local node of the blockchain. Note Parity isn't great if you are searching for old blocks/tx's.

## Scripts

- `find_blocknumber_at_datetime.py` - Find the closest blocknumber for past datetime. This is useful when wanting to find a range of blocks to search through.

- `get_list_of_top_hodlers.py` - Create a list of the top N (default 1,000,000) Ethereum hodlers that were active in a block range.
